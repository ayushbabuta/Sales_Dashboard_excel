NP Sales Dashboard 

About This Project
Hi! This is a dummy data analysis project I created using Excel and Power Query to practice my skills and build my portfolio. Itâ€™s based on sample sales data from FNP (Ferns N Petals) and shows how sales, customers, and products are performing across different occasions like Diwali, Holi, etc.

ðŸ”§ What I Did
Using Power Query, I cleaned and prepared the data:

Extracted Day, Month, Year from the order date

Created new columns like:

Revenue = Quantity Ã— Price

Delivery Days = Delivery Date - Order Date

This made it easier to analyze and visualize the data.

Key Insights in the Dashboard
Total Revenue: â‚¹35,20,984

Avg. Order Value: â‚¹3,520.98

Avg. Delivery Time: ~5 days

Deliveryâ€“Quantity Correlation: Very weak (almost no link)

 What Youâ€™ll See in the Dashboard

Diwali was the best-performing occasion in terms of sales.

Top Selling Items
Sweets were the top item, followed by Colors, Raksha Bandhan gifts, and Plants.

Revenue by Cities
Most orders came from Bidhannagar, followed by Maheshtala and Haridwar.

Who This Is For
This project is made as part of my practice as a fresher learning data analysis. It's a great example of how Excel and Power Query can be used to build real-world dashboards even with dummy data.
